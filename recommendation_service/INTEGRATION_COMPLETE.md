âœ… **Feedback System**: Successfully submitting user feedback

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### **1. Start the Recommendation Service:**
```bash
cd recommendation_service
python -c "from main import app; import uvicorn; uvicorn.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=8002)"
```

### **2. Start Your Dashboard:**

cd dashboard
npm run dev
```

### **3. Test the Integration:**
1. Go to the Roadmap page

2. **Test the integration** by completing roadmap topics
3. **Customize recommendations** by adding more project ideas
4. **Monitor user feedback** to improve recommendations
5. **Add more domains** or technologies as needed

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

The project recommendation system is now fully integrated with your PathWise roadmap system! Users will get intelligent project suggestions based on their learning progress, making their journey more engaging and practical.
